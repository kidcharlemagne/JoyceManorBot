========
Synopsis
========
A `Twitter bot <https://www.twitter.com/JoyceManorBot>`_ that scrapes Joyce Manor lyrics from the web and tweets them. 

====================
Ideas/Moving Forward
====================
#. AZLyrics blacklisted me. No bueno.
#. Parse output for just lyrics and write to file for each? Or massive file?
#. If 50 files are generated, I can randomly select one while the bot is running.
#. Host bot on Heroku?
#. Once every four hours or thirty minutes?
#. Check for repeats when selecting lyrics (i.e. avoid choruses that aren't as meaningful)
